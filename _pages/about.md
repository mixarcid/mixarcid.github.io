I'm a PhD student at UNC's Eschelman School of Pharmacy. By day, I apply novel ML algorithms to drug discovery. By night, I sleep.

Occasionally I write blog posts, usually about solving weird software issues.

If you want to chat about ML, drugs, or just about anything, please reach out! Email me at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
