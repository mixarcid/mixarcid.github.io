I'm a PhD student at UNC's Eshelman School of Pharmacy. Before, I studied chemistry at Stanford and worked as the Software Lead at [Quilter](https://www.quilter.ai).

I'm now researching novel AI methods to accelerate structure-based drug discovery. A major bottleneck in this field is the lack of high-quality training data. My research focuses on creatively using the available data to maximize model performance.
